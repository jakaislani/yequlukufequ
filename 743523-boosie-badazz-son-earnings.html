Catching up, he asked the 20-year-old what he's up to these days, to which he replied, "trappin'." After hearing this, Boosie lets his son know that he doesn't have to go to those lengths just to earn some cash, as he's more than willing to <a href=# rel>help him out</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel>"I got a bag for you,"</a> he told Tootie. The up-and-coming rapper then revealed that he's doing pretty well for himself with his current ventures, earning around $15K per day.

"I don't even know why you want to be out there," he says. "I don't get it. We made it out the hood. We made it out. <a href=# rel>Why would you want to go back?</a>" Boosie went on, expressing disappointment that his son prefers to spend time in Louisiana over Georgia, as he thinks Atlanta would be a lot safer for him. Clearly, Boosie's got a lot of love for his kids, and just wants what's best for all of them.</p><p>He also recently made his love for his daughter known, weighing in on her new relationship. "I’m not the type of daddy that get in my daughter’s relationships ‘bout no cheating or nothing like that," he explained. "But if you beat on her then that’s a different thing. That’s my problem … Me and my daughter, me and Pretty Black is <a href=# rel>thick as thieves</a>. I talk to her about anything. She talk to me about anything."
