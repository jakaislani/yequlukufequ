<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Barry movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2016)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Not a lot happens in this non-biopic of President Obama, and that’s fine. <a href=#>Adam Mansbach</a>’s script resists putting Barry on a narrative quest other than self-discovery, which concerns him finding his place, as a young black man, in the world. He interacts with different people, who provide perspective outside of the voice in his head. He has a girlfriend, Charlotte (<a href=#>Anya Taylor-Joy</a> of “<a href=#>The Witch</a>”), who tries to understand him personally, even connecting with him by saying that she spent five days in Kenya once. Later, while playing basketball, he meets PJ (<a href=#>Jason Mitchell</a> of “<a href=#>Straight Outta Compton</a>”), who provides Barry with a look at the projects while sharing his own hustle, which will lead towards a lucrative, corporate job. Barry's friends Saleem (<a href=#>Avi Nash</a>) and Will (<a href=#>Ellar Coltrane</a>) provide different ideas of how young, idealistic people try to connect with others. None of these supporting characters are particularly well-defined, despite the clear heart in each performance.</p><p>Gandhi’s filmmaking, his first time for a feature after examining fake icons with the gripping doc “Kumaré,” starts off with promise. I loved a righteously angry edit to the next scene after a white student asks Barry during a class debate, “Why is it always about slavery?,” not dignifying that with a response. But the script constantly undermines its potential, like a big scene at the end where Barry is shown at a very white wedding talking to two guests who are older, established and brilliant people of color. Their advice for him is hammy, however important, and the two are treated with an uncomfortable sense of being capital-S Special. Not because they are the only minorities invited to the wedding, but what they represent for the script. &nbsp;</p><p>There are moments in which “Barry” gets across what it wants to elucidate, and one involves Barry getting a mini tour from PJ in the projects before a party (PJ calls it “Projects Safari”). You can tell that Gandhi really cares about this scene as he shoots it with an extended Steadicam shot, but that isn’t what makes it memorable. Taken up the grimy stairs and down the ghostly hall of the apartment building, Barry is presented ideas of class and race he doesn’t see in his university bubble, with PJ ending the tour with the poignant statement of “This is what the government did to us.” The scene concludes later, with Barry leaving the party, saying “This ain’t my scene.” That line means much more than just his take on party culture, and it’s a type of delicacy the script’s dialogue could benefit more from.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bmKuqqWJ%2FcX2V</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zac-efrons-unrecognisable-new-look-in-the-iron-claw-stuns-fans-what-happened-to-his-face.html><span>←</span><span>Zac Efrons unrecognisable new look in The Iron Claw stuns fans: What happened to his fac</span></a>
