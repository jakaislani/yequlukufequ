I get it. Whiskey has a big, bold flavor and that can make it tougher to pair with whichever <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">soda</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sparkling water</a>, or<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> juice</a> you might have on hand. But if you stock up on the right carbonated beverages, whiskey can really sing. (Oh, and please note we’re talking about American and Canadian whiskeys here—if you insist on mixing scotch with anything besides <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">plain club soda</a>, you’re on your own.) So, grab a handle of Jim, Jack, or Crown, and let’s talk about the best soda to mix with whiskey, according to Sporked‘s own taste testers.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barritt’s Ginger Beer</a></strong><p>Buying a copper mug for Moscow Mules that one day you really felt like a Moscow Mule seemed like a good idea at the time, but now what do you do with it? Make a Whiskey Mule with Sporked’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ginger beer</a> of choice, which also happens to be one of the best sodas with whiskey. Barritt’s Ginger Beer really has it all: the right amount of sweetness, a somewhat aggressive gingery bite, and excellent effervescence to make it highly refreshing. Pair it with your whiskey of choice and we think you’ll agree that Barritt’s makes the best soda to mix with whiskey for a Whiskey Mule. Your copper mug runneth over.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best ginger beer</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sprecher Ginger Ale</a></strong><p>Whiskey and honey go together like peas and carrots, but, like, if peas and carrots could give you a buzz. If it’s not exactly Hot Toddy season, reach for Sprecher Ginger Ale. We love this stuff. It’s got a good gingery bite without drifting from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ginger ale</a> territory into <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ginger beer</a> territory. And, best of all, it’s sweetened with real honey. Yes, any ginger ale will technically do for a Whiskey Ginger, but we think this is one of the best sodas to mix with whiskey by a mile.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best ginger ale</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Diet Coke</a></strong><p>A lot of people prefer Diet Coke to regular Coke. We are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not among those people</a>. But hear us out: If you’re mixing a drink with a whiskey that leans sour or bitter, the extra saccharin sweetness of Diet Coke really makes the perfect cocktail. And, yes, the bonus is that the soda is zero calorie. Now you can use those soda calories for more important things, like the Taco Bell you’re surely going to GrubHub later.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best Coca-Cola flavors</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sanzo Yuzu</a></strong><p>Okay okay, I’ve put together a list of the best sodas with whiskey and I included something that’s technically a sparkling water. Put your pitchforks down—sparkling water is basically soda’s cousin (by blood, not even just marriage), so I think it counts. And Sanzo Yuzu tastes a lot like a lemon lime soda, so just imagine I’m recommending a 7UP but less sweet and more interesting. “It’s so bright and refreshing,” Sporked managing editor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwynedd Stuart</a> wrote. “And I love the nice, subtle bubbles, which make it super drinkable.” This is the best soda with whiskey if you want to mix things up a little.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best flavored seltzer and sparkling water</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Spindrift Lime</strong></a><p>Citrus is the perfect refresher on a warm summer day and, Spindrift Lime really was made to be enjoyed under the bright, beating sun. If you’re hoping to get a little tipsy outside this summer, reach for a can of Spindrift Lime to use as the best soda to mix with whiskey. It’s tart, bright, and delivers a punch of citrus flavor that is perfect at keeping you afloat while sipping in the pool. All rule followers are jumping to the comments to point out the fact that two-fifths of this list are sparkling waters but I promise you, one sip and you’ll agree we can bend the rules for the best sodas with whiskey when Spindrift is involved.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best Spindrift flavors</a></strong></p><h2>Subscribe</h2><p>Get all the top food rankings, new product reviews, and other grocery content delivered to your inbox every other week.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>By clicking submit you agree to our <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Terms of Use</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuv86dmGasn2K6qsSMsKCtoF2staq%2Fyp6waA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mike-rutherford-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mike Rutherford Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
