She also revealed that she had an abortion of her and King's unborn child in <i>1971</i> without taking any advice or permission of her husband.</p><p>In a bizarre twist of fate, the couple stayed married until Billie did infidelity again with her extra-marital partner, <strong>Ilana Kloss </strong>in <i>1987</i>. Nonetheless, Billie took Kings' son, <strong>Sky</strong> <strong>King</strong> (from Kings' second marriage with <strong>Nancy King</strong>) under her wings as a godmother.</p><p>Following the divorce, Billie re-married her former tennis doubles partner, Ilana<strong> </strong>in a low-key wedding ceremony.
