Proving that she can still live her best life, Savannah updated her Instagram on Saturday. She posted a sun-kissed snap of herself flaunting hints of her killer swimsuit body while rocking a cute bikini top. Savannah is followed by over 2 million but her posts aren’t just promoting her SASSY by Savannah makeup line and new podcast. Here, the daughter of Todd and Julie Chrisley proved that she’s summer-ready, and it looked like she was on vacation.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Savannah Chrisley poses in a hip-hugging mini dress and cowboy boots and asks her fans a question on Instagram. Savannah Chrisley also drew attention with her bikini style.</p><p>Savannah Chrisley has been killing her looks of late. <a href=#>#Bikini</a> <a href=#>#News</a>https://t.co/JPRDzCMRi8 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/KHseQOoo55</a></p><p>— GMSPORS (@Gmspors) <a href=#>August 25, 2022</a></p><h3>Bikini Bombshell Is Back</h3><p>All smiles and posing from an ocean setting and with water behind her, Savannah Chrisley stunned with her natural beauty.</p><p>The Southern Belle may not have gone for a full body shot, but she was more than flaunting what her momma gave her. The&nbsp;Chrisley Knows Best star was snapped showing off her upper body in a multicolor, slightly shimmery triangle bikini top. Going for fun silver, green, and pink, Savanna Chrisley gazed ahead as she enjoyed the ocean air.</p><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/fxD1UkLp0W</a></p><p>— Kelly Summers (@KellySummersTV) <a href=#>April 8, 2023</a></p><p>With the wind blowing her blonde locks around a little, Savannah also donned a pair of aviator shades. She added multiple necklaces to accessorize her swimwear. Flaunting a golden tan, Savannah Chrisley looked happy and healthy. Flashing her cleavage after a workout snap, Savannah further reminded fans that she’s as much curve as she is muscle.</p><h3>First Easter Without Parents</h3><p>Savannah may have been smiling in her Instagram Story, but she’s been getting honest about how much pain she’s in.</p><p>Posting&nbsp;for Easter as her parents spend the holiday behind bars, Savannah wrote:</p><p>“As this holiday weekend rolls around all I feel is grief. In 25 years I have never spent a single holiday without my sweet mama and daddy. Not only is Easter this weekend… but my daddy’s birthday is tomorrow. OH HOW I PRAY FOR TIME TO FLY! Can it be Monday already ? When you lose someone special, your world lacks its celebratory qualities. Holidays magnify that loss. The sadness deepens and the loneliness can feel isolating.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c5a5306fc68a9a10647ff72ed6e01ba?s=250&r=g"><p>Earlier this year, real estate mogul Todd and his wife Julie were jailed for bank fraud and tax evasion. They were sentenced to a combined prison term of 19 years. Sending her parents love, Savannah continued: “It is not the grief you want to avoid, it is the pain… I LOVE YOU MAMA AND DADDY!” Todd and Julie would likely be proud to see that Savannah is still able to have fun without them at this hard time.</p><p>Are you happy to see Savannah Chrisley out and about, living her best life despite the sadness within?
