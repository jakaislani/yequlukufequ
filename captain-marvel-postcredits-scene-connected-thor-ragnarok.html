In fact, if directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck had followed through on one of their early ideas, then the movie may have ended on the same planet that a certain God of Thunder would unintentionally visit a couple of decades later. And since this unrealized idea ties in heavily with the conclusion of Captain Marvel, be warned that some pretty big spoilers lie ahead.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>As those who’ve seen the film will know, the MCU’s latest release ends with Carol putting Yon-Rogg in his pod and sending him back to the Supreme Intelligence with a message. But in an interview with Empire, Fleck recalled how there was talk of a post-credits scene that showed Jude Law’s character going completely off course.</p><p>“There was an idea on the table about having Jude Law […] emerge from his pod on Sakaar,” said Fleck. “And then have him look around and see the Devil’s Anus behind him and wonder, ‘Where the hell am I?’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Captain-Marvel-Carol-Danvers-and-Maria-Rambeau.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Captain-Marvel-Carol-Danvers.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Captain-Marvel-Bron-Char-and-Minn-Erva.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Captain-Marvel-Captain-Marvel-Bron-Char-and-Yon-Rogg.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Captain-Marvel-Ronan-the-Accuser.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Captain-Marvel-Skrulls-1.jpg><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>The coliseum planet of Sakaar was first seen in 2017’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Thor: Ragnarok</a>, in which Chris Hemsworth’s character is forced into battle for the Grandmaster’s amusement. Once the planet’s ruler is overthrown, the movie’s post-credits scene offers a very similar scenario to Fleck’s idea, as the Grandmaster crashes his ship and finds himself at the mercy of his former subjects.</p><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=false>Given the parallels between the two sequences, it might be for the best that <strong>Captain Marvel </strong>scrapped the idea, especially if it gives <a href=# rel=noopener>Captain Marvel 2</a> more of a blank canvas for continuing Yon-Rogg’s story. Speaking of which, Kevin Feige has already heavily hinted that Carol Danvers’ next solo film will be <a href=# rel=noopener>another period flick</a> that picks up where the first movie left off. But before we find out what’s next in the Kree-Skrull saga, we’ll be seeing Brie Larson back on our screens when <a href=# rel=noopener>Avengers: Endgame</a> hits theaters on April 26th.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJompqopJa2r3nMmqmvnZxivbC%2F05ypnpyZqcBuv8KepZ5lk6S7r7HCrZydZaSdvLN50Zqep5mipLhw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./star-wars-introduces-a-new-inquisitor-whos-going-to-give-reva-a-run-for-her-money.html><span>←</span><span>Star Wars introduces a new Inquisitor whos going to give Reva a run for her money</span></a>
