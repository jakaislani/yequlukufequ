Each one of the Italian seasoning ingredients serves a distinct culinary purpose in the mix to help create an earthy, aromatic flavor that comes across with slight peppery and sweet notes.

Basil gives off a slightly sweet aroma and is often used on pizza or in the classic caprese salad.</description></item><item><title>White Men Can't Jump movie review (1992)</title><link>/white-men-cant-jump-1992.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/white-men-cant-jump-1992.html</guid><description>What the movie knows is how the game is played in the tough urban circles where these guys operate. The director, Ron Shelton, who also wrote the screenplay, knows how his characters talk and sound, and how they get into each other's minds with nonstop taunting and boasting.

The tall-and-tanned-young-and-lovely girl
With a voice as light as air
Nobody knows but no one cares
'Cause everybody loves her
When she signs makes you dream a fairy taleWith a certain smile
She can make you feel so nice
Saying gently "Goodbye sadness"
Still will break your heart
Listen to her once
You'll feel lucky she was there
