Nothing official came from Drake’s rep about the rumor that he had a child, but when Pusha <a href=#>went hard</a> on his song, he all but confirmed that <a href=#>Drake’s son</a>, named Adonis, truly did exist. Fast forward to 2018, and Drake’s out here showing off his son’s accomplishments front and center.</p><p>On Dec. 26, Drake took to Instagram to make a pretty lofty claim about his son, Adonis. “Adonis > Picasso don’t @ me 💙🎄,” he captioned a sweet photo of framed artwork from his son, who is a little over a year old.</p><p>The artwork in question looks like an elaborate finger painting, which seems appropriate for a baby, but Drake’s comment&nbsp;presupposes that Adonis’ finger painting skills put him past masters of the field, such as Pablo Picasso.</p><p>Considering Picasso’s style and affinity for breaking the rules, Adonis’ work technically puts him on par with Pablo, but his age gives him the leg up. In short, Drake’s caption is entirely accurate and we’re just gonna have to watch out for this genius artist in the future. Just look at that color palette!</p><p>Back in May, Pusha T reignited a past feud between porn star <a href=#>Sophia Brussaux</a> and Drake, in which <a href=#>Sophie</a> accused Drake of <a href=#>getting her pregnant</a>. For a while, nothing came of the rumors, but after Pusha essentially outed Drake’s family, the Toronto native decided to come clean about his son. “I wasn’t hiding my kid from the world/I was hiding the world from my kid,” Drake rapped on the track “Emotionless,” from his most recent album,&nbsp;Scorpion.&nbsp;</p><p>Though we’re glad Drake and his family celebrated the holidays together for their baby’s <a href=#>second Christmas</a>, we can’t help but hope for a baby pic next time around! New Years, Valentine’s, Easter… just pick a holiday, Drake. There’s a bunch coming up and we’re just dying to see this cute little Greek God.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJom6uZm5p6tLTOsKpmp5abeqm10maqqKZdlrGwusisZJqcn6euo7jEZpirrKekv6x5zqdkoqajqa6ovsCmZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./caroline-catz-net-worth-133605.html><span>←</span><span>Caroline Catz Net Worth</span></a>
