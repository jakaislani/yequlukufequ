The Toasted Coconut is fairly standard and reminiscent of something I’ve tasted before (keep your head on a swivel, Jelly Belly). The Hazelnut flavor just doesn’t taste like hazelnut. I was expecting something akin to Nutella, but only got bland, sugary sweetness. This brings me to the beast…French Vanilla, a.k.a. Vanilly Illy. Sporked staff writer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Myrick</a> said, “It tastes like toothpaste.” And were they wrong? Absolutely not. Staff writer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Danny Palumbo</a> decided it tastes artificial and saccharine, like those vanilla creamers from the gas station. French Vanilla aside, I will say that Frankford, the company responsible for bringing us these beans, is doing something truly wonderful with the Caramel Latte flavor. If they ever decide to package individual flavors, I’m parking a bag of these babies right next to my desk. The Butter Pecan isn’t anything to scoff at either. It has just the right blend of butteriness and sugariness all rolled into one cute little bean. Altogether, this isn’t a bad bag of beans, but if you’re specifically looking for coffee flavor, approach it with an open mind. America might want to find something else to run on.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Ryan Martin / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>6/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p>Sorry.
