Our Review of Easter Sunday M&amp;amp;Ms</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>When I first heard that the new M&M’s hitting stores for the annual <a href=#>Easter candy</a>-buying season were called Easter Sundae M&M’s, I asked myself (and the rest of the Sporked crew, unfortunately), “Is an ‘Easter sundae’ a thing I’m not aware of?” I promise I’m a college-educated adult with an (almost) fully functioning brain, but the very obvious pun sailed right over my big, dumb head. Easter Sunday: a thing. Easter Sundae: not a thing…until now! We got our hands on a bag and tasted these new M&M’s to find out if they’re worth the space in your Easter basket this year.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="easter sundae m&M's review" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NPR_EASTER-SUNDAE-MMS_INSET.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">New Product!</p><strong>Easter Sundae M&M’s</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>On the front of the bag, these new M&M’s are described as white and dark chocolate M&M’s. As soon as I tasted a couple, it was apparent that there’s more going on than that. You see that little hot fudge sundae the M&M bunny is holding on the package? It has a cherry on top—and a kick of cherry is what makes these M&M’s interesting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> If you like chocolate-covered cherries, you’re going to like these new M&M’s. They have a really pleasant <a href=#>maraschino flavor</a>, although it threatens to overpower the delicate flavor of the white chocolate. Easter Sundae M&M’s are a nice size, too—they’re as big as Peanut Butter M&M’s (one of the <a href=#>best M&M’s flavors</a>) even though they don’t have a filling. I also appreciated the attempt at a correct dark chocolate-to-white chocolate ratio. The milder tasting white chocolate portion, which is surrounded by dark chocolate and then the candy shell, is much more substantial than the dark chocolate portion.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: The color palette is a little bit weird for an Easter product. Instead of pastels we get red, brown, and a bone-colored beige (sorry, that was the best way I could think of to describe it). If you’re looking for an Easter treat that screams spring, this probably isn’t it.&nbsp;<br>All in all, these taste more like chocolate-covered cherries than a sundae made predominantly with <a href=#>vanilla ice cream</a>. I wasn’t blown away, but I did find myself continuing to eat them after our taste test.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-link-color has-small-font-size wp-elements-f16c2580a41ac915aaf83ab25b90c6ff">Credit: Liv Averett / M&M’s</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><a href=# class="lazy-load-youtube preview-lazyload preview-youtube" data-video-title="Mtn Dew Purple Thunder Taste Test | Sporked" title='Play video "Mtn Dew Purple Thunder Taste Test | Sporked"' rel=noopener>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naVGjbmMcd8&list=PLHbjKrchTZzsSSNxQfCn9JpW3evHOmxqK</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJ2RqMGmvoysrKeckZp6rrnSZqmerpmaxHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./betty-moffitt.html><span>←</span><span>How Old Was Billie Jean King's Mother, Betty Moffitt At The Time Of Her Death?</span></a>
