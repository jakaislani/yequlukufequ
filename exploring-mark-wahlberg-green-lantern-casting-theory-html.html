Some fans have suggested that these mugshots might have been present at the office of&nbsp;<span>either Zack Snyder or Charles Roven, who were then directing and producing Batman V Superman respectively.&nbsp;</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span>In addition to Batman V Superman, Snyder and Roven were also producing the 2017 superhero ensemble Justice League at the time</span><span>.&nbsp;According to the theory, they were actively looking for potential actors to&nbsp;play&nbsp;Green Lantern in&nbsp;the film.</span></p><p><span>Hence,&nbsp;it is possible to suggest based on the speculative theory that&nbsp;Warner Bros might have&nbsp;been interested to&nbsp;cast Wahlberg as the Green Lantern in DCEU's&nbsp;Justice League.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Wahlberg a Solid Choice For Guy Gardner</h2><p><span>Wahlberg would certainly be a very interesting choice to play a Green Lantern in the upcoming Green Lantern Corps movie. Given Wahlberg's past roles in The Other Guys (2010) and The Departed (2006) as cocky and domineering police officers,&nbsp;a lantern that comes to mind&nbsp;is Guy Gardner.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>If Tom Cruise as Hal Jordan&nbsp;is something not possible&nbsp;at this time</a>, then Wahlberg as Gardner would definitely lend some box-office credibility to the planned reboot.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Guy Gardner in Green Lantern Corps</h2><p>Guy Gardner appearing in the Green Lantern Corps reboot is not just&nbsp;speculation though.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Screenwriter and executive producer Geoff John has listed a picture referencing to the upcoming film on his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">website</a>, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The picture shows&nbsp;Guy Gardner standing alongside Hal Jordan and John Stewart.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"></a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Picture from Geff John's website&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In the 'Green Lantern' plotlines based comics, Guy Gardner is despised by other members of the corps because he is an obnoxious and outspoken bully.
