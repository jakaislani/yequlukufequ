We call <b>scones</b> “<b>scones</b>”, just like the British do. Most <b>Americans</b> know the difference between the two. A biscuit (in <b>the USA</b>) is a savory quick bread that is usually round and is served buttered with a meal, or sometimes with gravy.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-are-scones-called-biscuits-in-america></span>Why are scones called biscuits in America?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>No, <b>egg</b>. But lard, instead of butter. The Bero book <b>has</b> different <b>scone</b> recipes, with and without <b>eggs</b>, described as plain and rich <b>scones</b>. They aren’t cakey because it’s a different method and less butter, <b>egg</b> and sugar.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-exactly-is-a-scone></span>What exactly is a scone?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Shaping them does tend to be <b>hard</b> when you’re dough is slightly sticky. Actually, if you’re able to shape them as nicely as a bread, your dough most likely isn’t sticky enough! One of many <b>scone</b> trials, the ones on the left have been shaped into a ball by hand, the ones on the right were just cut out.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-does-the-queen-say-scone></span>How does the queen say scone?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>People often wonder why the English <b>called</b> a <b>cookie</b> a <b>biscuit</b> (or a sweet <b>biscuit</b>) and why we, in America <b>call</b> the same sort of thing a <b>cookie</b>. New York became such an important city that the word <b>cookie</b>, which we got from the Dutch, became the standard word for all such baked goods.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-scones-called-in-america></span>What are scones called in America?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Biscuit (<b>UK</b>) / Cookie (US)In the US, <b>cookies</b> are flat, round snacks made of sweet dough. In the <b>UK</b>, these are generally <b>called</b> biscuits, although people do call the bigger, softer kind <b>cookies</b>, too.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=should-scones-have-egg-in-them></span>Should scones have egg in them?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The word <b>biscuit</b> derives from the Latin bis, meaning twice, and coctus, meaning cooked. The term came into use in 14th century England to describe a confection that is baked and then dried out, to produce a hard, flat item that goes soft over time and delicious when dipped in a cup of tea.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-scones-supposed-to-be-soft-or-hard></span>Are scones supposed to be soft or hard?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In British <b>English</b>, <b>crackers</b> are sometimes <b>called</b> water biscuits, or savory biscuits.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-do-americans-call-biscuits-cookies></span>Why do Americans call biscuits cookies?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>British Vs.

The Middle French word bescuit is derived from the Latin words bis (<b>twice</b>) and coquere, coctus (to cook, <b>cooked</b>), and, hence, means “<b>twice</b>–<b>cooked</b>“. This is because <b>biscuits</b> were originally <b>cooked</b> in a twofold process: first <b>baked</b>, and then dried out in a slow oven.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-oldest-biscuit-in-the-world></span>What is the oldest biscuit in the world?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In the case of <b>Australian</b> slang, words are clipped, and then a diminutive suffix is added to the clipped word. In this case, bikkie (the colloquial <b>Australian</b> word for a cookie), is clipped slang for <b>biscuit</b> (the British English word for a type of cookie), and it uses the -ie diminutive suffix.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-biscuit-male-or-female></span>Is Biscuit male or female?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Spotlight On <b>Australia’s Favourite Biscuit</b>, The Tim Tam. <b>Australia’s</b> much-loved chocolate <b>biscuit</b>, two chocolate malted <b>biscuits</b>, light chocolate filling in between and a coat of melted chocolate, has impressed not only locals, but the world at large, too.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-biscuit-mean-twice-baked></span>Does biscuit mean twice baked?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Much like cake, <b>cookies</b> are made from a soft, thick dough and are denser than an English <b>biscuit</b>. When they are finished, <b>cookies</b> are larger, softer, and chunkier than their <b>biscuit</b> cousins. In contrast, the word “<b>biscuit</b>” comes from the Latin ‘bis’ (twice) and ‘coquere’ (cooked). It essentially means twice baked!<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6jBrq3SrZyrZp%2Bnrq95zKipZ5ufY8Kse8Vwm26hZJl8uLTIs2afbGZqsqd%2Bj2efraWc</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./count-basie.html><span>←</span><span>Count Basie - Songs, Band &amp;amp; Facts</span></a>
