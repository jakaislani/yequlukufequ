If the name rings a bell, that might be because it was announced some time ago with its first gallery of stills hitting the web <a href=#>roughly a year back</a>. A spin on the spy genre, Hailee Steinfeld stars as a young girl born into a life of training, guns and super-cool special ops stuff. Unlike most action leads with a license to kill however, Steinfeld’s teen is more concerned with the social web of high school.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=522 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>Right off the bat, Barely Lethal sounds as if it plans on occupying space that could easily be filled by Black Widow and/or Hit-Girl spinoffs. Unlike that dynamite pair though, Steinfeld’s Hayley Walsh is an orphan raised in an educational environment wherein she’s taught how to be a killer. Desperate for a normal life, she fakes her death and begins attending a regular high school. She can’t outrun the past however. And, so begins a ton of shoot-outs as the life she left behind catches up with her.</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>The trailer presents its leading lady in a favorable light. Steinfeld is as charismatic and compelling as ever, and her veritable array of co-stars tuck into their roles with as much enthusiasm as they can muster. It might lean a little heavy on the cliches, but with Newman at the helm, there’s a good chance that the finished product will iron out any bumps.</p><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=532 data-injectable=true>Co-starring Jessica Alba, Samuel L. Jackson, Dan Fogler, Jaime King, Sophie Turner, and Thomas Mann&nbsp;<strong>Barely Lethal</strong> is expected to land in US theaters later this year.</p><p>“A teenage special ops agent coveting a ‘normal’ adolescence fakes her own death and enrolls in a suburban high school. She quickly learns that surviving the treacherous waters of high school is more challenging than international espionage.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon5qhnJqybr%2FTnqCnnpWhsW63yJyirGWSqsG1edOenKeZl5p6or%2FSmqqsoZ5ir6K%2BxKWwZqSVqbWiuIytqZqhnJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./furies-movie-review-2023.html><span>←</span><span>Furies movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)</span></a>
