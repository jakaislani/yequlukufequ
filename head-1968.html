The film's success is in a series of satires on movie clichés, and in several blackouts. These are probably Nicholson's, and worth seeing.</p><p>We get the destruction of a Coke machine, a montage of three stereotyped desert scenes, a Western shoot-out with fake arrows, a Hollywood soda fountain brawl, things like that. They're good, and the rest of the movie (including trick photography that already seems out of date) isn't unpleasant. And you may, for metaphysical private reasons of your own appreciate the scene where The Monkees play dandruff in Victor Mature's hair.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46hnJqcXWaGd4Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./details-found-in-pop-smokes-death-certificate.html><span>←</span><span>Details Found In Pop Smoke's Death Certificate</span></a>
