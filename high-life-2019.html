It makes the ship feel as tactile as the interior of a submarine, or a prison. Atmosphere and sensation are everything.&nbsp;The sound of a character's breathing, footsteps or muttered curses&nbsp;can be as meaningful&nbsp;as any expository line of dialogue (of which there are surprisingly few until Binoche's spacey-scary Dr. Dibs starts monologuing).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-children-count=0>What does it all mean? I have a take but would rather not share it here, in a review that's trying to convey the spirit of an elliptical and mysterious film without revealing all of&nbsp;its surprises and puzzlements. Suffice to say that it's the kind of movie that's direct enough in its imagery&nbsp;to make you feel as if you're just visiting a place that exists, yet expansive enough in its poetic and narrative aspirations to make room for&nbsp;a spacewalk, a daringly extended sequence of a crew-member riding a sex machine,&nbsp;several idealistic conversations&nbsp;about science and survival, a psychedelic mission to a black hole, and a final act that's at once&nbsp;inspirational and unbearably sad.</p><p data-children-count=0>It's the kind of film that sparks arguments on the way home, not just about what happened and what it meant, but whether it was a good movie—and if not, precisely which expectations it failed to satisfy, and whether it ever intended&nbsp;to satisfy them.&nbsp;With its&nbsp;brutal violence,&nbsp;explicit sex, and up-close views of blood, sweat, urine, and semen, it is&nbsp;proudly&nbsp;an R-rated film, verging on NC-17—though the X-rating, which was discontinued by the MPAA almost 30 years ago,&nbsp;might feel&nbsp;more appropriate. Everything about this movie&nbsp;is retro, from the opaque yet fully felt performances (led by Pattinson) that make the audience come to the actors rather than the other way around,&nbsp;to Stuart Staples' analog&nbsp;synthesizer-heavy&nbsp;soundtrack, to the closing credits song by Tindersticks featuring none other than Pattinson, whose vocals suggest what <a href=#>Chris Isaak</a> might sound like if he lost his will to live.&nbsp;</p><p data-children-count=0>If you've read this far, you know whether this is your kind of movie. If&nbsp;you think it is, it is—and then some.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46hoKCgXaG2p7GMa2dqcQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-peter-parkers-parents.html><span>←</span><span>What happened to Peter Parkers parents?</span></a>
