<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>How Long Did Hornswoggle Know He Would Be McMahon's Son</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>It is one of the most controversial and disturbing storylines in the history of the WWE. On the Sept. 10, 2007 episode of Monday Night Raw, Hornswoggle was revealed to be the son of WWE chairman, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vince McMahon</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The whole storyline received backlash and heavy criticism from wrestling fans and pundits. Thankfully, the storyline only lasted a few short months -&nbsp;concluding with John Bradshaw Layfield announcing that Finlay was the real father of Hornswoggle.</p><p>Hornswoggle recently appeared on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pancakes and Powerslams Show</a>&nbsp;and went into full detail about how he found out that Vince McMahon would become his storyline father:</p><p>“Two hours. I thought it was a complete joke, and it was awesome to me because it was my hometown. Bruce Prichard came up to me and he said, ‘I need your phone.’ [I said], ‘for what?’ [He said], ‘I need your phone.’ [I responded] ‘Okay?’ He held my phone for the night so it wouldn’t get out, and told me.”</p><p>WWE had been building up towards a storyline that hinted at Mr. Kennedy being the father of Hornswoggle. But for unknown reasons, the creative team (and Mr. McMahon), decided that the billionaire was the right fit as his kayfabe father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The storyline then saw Mr. McMahon try to show Hornswoggle "tough love," by forcing him to face much bigger and stronger opponents. This included Jamie Noble and The Great Khali. There was also a forgettable segment in which Vince viciously attacked Hornswoggle with a belt.</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WWE STORYLINES THAT WERE ACTUALLY MEANT AS PUNISHMENTS</a></strong></p><p>Long after the controversial storyline, Hornswoggle would see more successful runs in the WWE. The former Cruiserweight Champion became "the official mascot of D-Generation X," and supported <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Triple H </a>and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shawn Michaels</a>. He&nbsp;was also revealed to be the anonymous Raw general manager on the July 9, 2012 episode of the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wwe.com/f/styles/wwe_large/public/rd-talent/Bio/Hornswoggle_bio.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hornswoggle had a nice run in the WWE, and being loved by the fans for his underdog story and humorous character. The Vince McMahon father storyline may have been a regrettable decision by the creative team, but at least Hornswoggle was able to make a name for himself. He now works in the independent circuit, but perhaps a return to the WWE isn't out of he question.</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BACKSTAGE INCIDENTS OF A WRESTLER TURNING DOWN A STORYLINE</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenp7K0wMuipaBnmKS%2Fr7%2FWqJ6gpJViw6q6wp5kppudlrWwuoyspqdn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./empress-elisabeth-of-austria-net-worth-330825.html><span>←</span><span>Empress Elisabeth of Austria Net Worth</span></a>
