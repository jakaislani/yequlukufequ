Contestants make more and more money depending on how far they advance in the competition, and their level of fame has nothing to do with their salary on the show — how wild is that?</p><p data-characters=492 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>“For stars who make it to weeks three and four, there is an added bonus amount of $10,000 per week. If they make it to week five, the additional pay is $15,000. Weeks six and seven add $20,000 per week, and then weeks eight and nine see $30,000 deposited in their bank account… If they are lucky enough to make the semi-finals and the finale, there is an additional $50,000 prize money each week, plus the winner gets the Mirrorball Trophy,” an article from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parade</a> revealed.</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>While this is a lot of money that the celebrities have a chance to earn, what is the starting salary for weeks one and two, as well as the countless number of rehearsals leading up to the show?</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>, “Contestants on the&nbsp;ABC&nbsp;competition series make $125,000 for the show’s rehearsal period and their first two weeks on the air. If they make it to week three and beyond, they begin to earn additional fees each week.”</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>Given that this information was revealed back in 2019, who knows if the stars are making more or less money than before. Nonetheless, this is a whopping wad of cash to add to their bank account, on top of all of the funds they have undoubtedly collected due to their time in the limelight…</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=false>Dancing With the Stars will return to our screens with a highly-anticipated premiere episode on Tuesday, September 26, at 8pm ET/PT, and after that, brand new episodes will air weekly on ABC or Disney Plus — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with such a star-studded cast</a>, it is sure to be a season to remember!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9ZmpK6bmGK6sLrEsmSdp12lv7C%2FjJqlnWWTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2K6orfEZqanZZSWu6S1zaBksKGknXq1tMRmqq2Zoqh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amanda-lemos-bio-age-height-parents-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Amanda Lemos Bio, Age, Height, Parents, Net Worth</span></a>
