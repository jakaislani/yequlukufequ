The second season kicked off with the graduates bracing themselves to prove to Pierpont that they deserved a chance to be part of their company. Created by Mickey Down and Konrad Kay, the industry series is a drama show that first <a href=#>premiered on HBO</a> in 2020. The show did so well that it got renewed for the second season, which premiered on August 2022. Now that the series has been green-lit for another interesting season, it is only normal for fans to be interested in when the show comes to our screens and the favorite actors who will be reprising their roles. Here is everything we know about the upcoming drama show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Industry Season 3 Release Date: When will it be telecasted?</h2><p>The Industry series’s renewal did not come as a surprise as it had been doing extremely well. It was only a matter of time before the Industry series was renewed for the second season, an announcement that came in October 2022. We are still determining when the show’s third season will be premiering. The show’s second season premiered a year after the show had been renewed for the second season. According to the series renewal and premiere schedule, the perfect release date is 2023.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Industry Season 3 Plot: What will happen?</h2><p>Season two of the show explored the life of the young bankers striving independently to excel in Industry. It also answered the question of where Robert was and whether he was different than he was at the start of the show’s first season. In season one, he was known as a confident man with a peaceful yet brave aura. Still, in the second season, he was more like seeking external validation from anybody and everybody, like his charm and confidence had worn off. They also had new management, which was not as conducive as the former, and the young bankers had to compromise and play the game of survival of the fittest. Despite not knowing what the show’s third season will entail, we know it will take off from where the second Industry season commenced.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Industry Season 3 Cast: Who will be coming back?</h2><p>Despite the show’s casting not being announced, we already know we will see many familiar faces in the show’s third season. We expect to see Myha’la Herrold, the lead cast, returning to reprise her role as Harper Stern. We expect Marosa Abela, Harry Lawtey, David Jonsson, Connor MacNeil, Alex Lomar Akpobome, Katrine de Candole, Ken Leung, and Indy Lewis to be back. Other casts include Sarah Parish, Sagar Radia, Caoilfhionn, and Nicholas Bishop.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Industry Season 3 Trailer: When can we watch it?</h2><p>Unfortunately, the season three trailer of Industry is yet to be released, and we do not know how soon the trailer will be available. However, you can watch the show’s second and first-season trailers on HBO. If you did not watch both the first and second seasons of the drama show, then you may want to do so on Either Hulu, Disney, or ESPN+. There are also several other shows with the same genre that you can check out. <a href=#>Billions</a>, <a href=#>Bad Sisters</a>, <a href=#>Succession</a>, and <a href=#>The Bear</a> are all on Apple Tv.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBtbvPqZyrq16YvK57yKebrqukp8Zuv8SaqqimXaeyrbHArJxmnJGpsm6vwKyrZqicpMFuvNGem6KbpJ68r7%2BMramaoZyav3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amanda-thibault.html><span>←</span><span>Did Local 22 &amp;amp; Local 44 Chief Meteorologist, Amanda Thibault Have A Baby?
