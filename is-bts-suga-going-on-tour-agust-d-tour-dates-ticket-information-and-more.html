There will be both ARMY Member Presale and General Verified Fan Presale for those wishing to buy tickets. Registration is available from today until Feb. 23 at 10pm ET. ARMY Member Presale will begin on March 1 from 3pm to 10pm the local time of the venue and General Verified Fan Presale will be on March 2 during the same hours. Tickets will go on sale to the general public (theoretically, this is BTS we’re talking about here) on March 3 at 3pm local time.</p><p data-characters=635 data-current-count=635 data-injectable=true>Ticketmaster makes it very clear they will not save tickets for sale to the general public and every ticket will be available during ARMY Member Presale. For the best chance at grabbing tickets, you can register for ARMY Member Presale (the pre-presale, if you will) by purchasing an ARMY membership through WeVerse, priced at $22 per year. Then, you must register for ARMY Member Presale on WeVerse and then on Ticketmaster, using your 9-digit ARMY membership number. Invitations to ARMY Member Presale will be sent by email the evening of Feb. 28. You will only receive this email if you registered on both WeVerse and Ticketmaster.</p><h2 id=h-agust-d-tour-setlist data-injectable=false>Agust D tour setlist</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by SUGA of BTS 민윤기 (@agustd)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=822 data-injectable=true>SUGA has released two mixtapes as Agust D – his 2016 debut Agust D and his 2020 follow-up D-2. While it’s too early to know exactly which songs SUGA will perform on his world tour, it’s probably a safe bet the rapper will perform singles like “Daechwita,” “Agust D,” and “Give it to Me.” SUGA has a popular career as a producer for other K-pop artists and it’ll be interesting to see if he brings out collaborators like IU, Heize, or Suran on one of his tour stops.</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>A tour seems like the perfect opportunity for new music but there’s no confirmation as of yet whether SUGA will release a new album before touring. We’re always happy to hear more solo music from BTS and we wouldn’t be shocked if SUGA starts teasing some new music in the near future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46iqmaapKh6tMHGmmSgp5mjtG67zWarqK2iYq6owdKtZJ1lpKTCs3nDmqueq12ptqS3xK1koqaWpL%2BurdOipqdlkaOxbrnOq5xo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./easy-no-knead-cheddar-rolls.html><span>←</span><span>Easy No-Knead Cheddar Rolls - Mom On Timeout</span></a>
