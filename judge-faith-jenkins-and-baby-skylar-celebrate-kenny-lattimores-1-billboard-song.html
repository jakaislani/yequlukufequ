The new mom recently took to Instagram with their daughter, Skylar Leigh Lattimore, to celebrate her husband on his chart-topping song.</p><p>“There aren’t too many things that can get me out of my baby bubble these days but Kenny’s song becoming #1 in America on @billboard’s adult R&B chart is one of them,” Judge Faith said. I’m SO proud,” she exclaimed.</p><p>“Kenny is a master at staying focused, putting his head down, and working! And look at God,” the judge exclaimed. “We put this (and our baby) on our vision board — and I’ve now watched both birthed into reality!”</p><p>This year is <a href=# rel=noopener>turning out to be fantastic</a> for the Lattimores. It was just a few weeks ago that Kenny and Faith welcomed their baby girl. Skylar Leigh Lattimore was born to parents who were more than thrilled to meet her for the first time.</p><p>“Welcome to the world Skylar Leigh Lattimore,” Faith and Kenny shared with their social media fans. “And just like that life has taken on a whole new meaning,” the celebrity couple revealed.</p><p>Life began to <a href=# rel=noopener>take on new meaning</a> for the Lattimores last year. It was during the summer months that Faith and Kenny announced their expectancy of a child. The excited couple used the family dog to help spread the news.</p><p>“The last nine months you have supported me in all the ways I needed it most,” Faith told Kenny last month <a href=# rel=noopener>after giving birth</a>. “I watched you juggle a lot with your schedule and you somehow managed to balance it all,” the new mom shared with her husband.</p><p>“If Skylar ever wants to know what true love looks like, she will look no further than you,” Faith told Kenny.</p><p>Skylar is Faith Jenkins and Kenny Lattimore’s first child together. Kenny released his chart-topping single while preparing for her arrival. Fans of the R&B singer can stream the track on all major music platforms.</p><p>Photo: Judge Faith Jenkins/Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOo6ydn5Vis6K106Fko52eoLavv4yapZ1lkpavunnSpLClmaJisKa4xJupmqyVYrimus2yZKWZpKm2rrvRnqpmaV2Xtq24waiYq5xdqLyvs44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./howard-eisley-net-worth-250281.html><span>←</span><span>Howard Eisley Net Worth</span></a>
