The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">self-proclaimed strongest man in the world</a> is counting on the others to set him free, preferably before the Prison Realm finishes processing him. As manga readers already know and anime viewers can easily guess, the task will be far from easy. That said, there’s no doubt that it will provide us with some great content, which is all the more reason for you not to miss out on the next episode.</p><h2 id=h-where-and-when-to-watch-jujutsu-kaisen-season-2-episode-11 data-injectable=false>Where and when to watch Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode 11</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/nobara-jujutsu-kaisen.jpg><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=725 data-injectable=true>Episode 11 of Jujutsu Kaisen’s second season will be released in Japan at 12am JST on Oct. 6. Thanks to timezone differences, for Western fans this means that the episode will be available to stream on Crunchyroll on Thursday, Oct. 5, at 10am PT. This has been the case with previous episodes in season 2 and, unless something unexpected happens, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the release schedule will likely be the same</a> for the remaining episodes.</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>If you’re hoping to watch the episode dubbed, though, you’ll have to wait a while longer. Crunchyroll releases dubs for Jujutsu Kaisen on the same day of release, yes, but only at 1:30pm PT. So, are you sure you still want to hold off on watching this episode until the English dub premieres? The choice is up to you, of course, but it’ll be a tough wait, surely.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6jrKOtpKjCbrfAoqqepl2osqK%2Fzqdka2WVpba0u8OeZGppXaeyrbHArJxmnJGpsm7AyKacZpmemXq4tMSrnGasn2LEosDCoWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./category.html><span>←</span><span>Corn Salsa</span></a>
