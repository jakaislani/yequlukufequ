He hasn’t arrived in any pro wrestling company yet, because he’s still under a non-compete clause, but he still has a great sense of humor about the situation.</p><p>Rawley tweeted out a thought that he might have entered the pro wrestling world a bit too early, perhaps a decade or two prior to when he would have really been successful. “I really needed to be a pro wrestler about 2-3 decades ago, agree?” he tweeted out.</p><p>Later on, he sent out a very interesting tweet about sending in his information to Uber for a job. We’re sure that he’s joking by the reference to 69 that he laid down, but it was still rather amusing.</p><p>If anyone is looking for a job…. @Uber and @lyft rides are approximately $69 for a 6-9min ride these days. I am submitting my application right now.</p><p>We’ll have to see what he does next. Mojo already has a role in the <a href=#>upcoming GI Joe origins movie for Snake Eyes. </a>We’re not sure how large his part is, but Mojo is seen in the trailer getting pummeled.</p><p>Mojo Rawley has a ton of intensity and plenty of pro wrestling training. He never really took off in WWE, but that might not be the case elsewhere. Only time will tell where we’ll see Mojo next. He might just be your Uber driver someday.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on Mojo Rawley’s future in pro wrestling?
