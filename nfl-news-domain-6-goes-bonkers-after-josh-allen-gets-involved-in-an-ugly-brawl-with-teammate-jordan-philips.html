While some teams have been greeted with massive crowds during the camp, some have struggled to attract any attention at all. While the Bills certainly fall in the first category, a recent altercation during the training camp involving Allen ended up giving the fans a mighty scare.</p><p>While it is an accepted norm that the star quarterback is not touched during practice, recently, <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://firstsportz.com/category/nfl/buffalo-bills/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Bills</a> defensive tackle <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Phillips rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Phillips</a> ended up getting a little too close to Josh Allen. After Allen was bumped into by Phillips, the star Quarterback turned around, went back to Phillips and shoved him.</p><p>As expected, the clips of the incident started going viral on social media and fans were left bewildered by what had transpired. Here are sa few reactions:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Different angle better view of the fight.
