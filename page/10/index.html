According to an interview Ozzy gave to Metal Hammer a few years after Lemmy died (via The Express), the Prince of Darkness was probably the last person to speak to Lemmy on the phone, on December 28, 2015, since he died very shortly thereafter, of prostate cancer, cardiac arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Enrico Colantoni Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>
