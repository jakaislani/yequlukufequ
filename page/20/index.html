<a href=../../the-radeon-r9-290x-review.html></a>
Crysis 3 Still one of our most punishing benchmarks, Crysis 3 needs no introduction. With Crysis 3, Crytek has gone back to trying to kill computers and still holds “most punishing shooter” title in our benchmark suite. Only in a handful of setups can we even run Crysis 3 at its highest (Very High) settings, and that’s still without AA. Crysis 1 was an excellent template for the kind of performance required to drive games for the next few years, and Crysis 3 looks to be much the same for 2013.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Furies movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)</h2><time>Aug 4, 2024</time>
<a href=../../furies-movie-review-2023.html></a>
“Furies” pales compared to the relatively confident “Furie” in any scene where the characters have to relate to each other beyond propulsive violence. Action director Samuel Kefi Abrikh, who also choreographed the fight scenes in “Furie,” still delivers a number of stand-out moments, but the ensemble cast members aren’t as memorable when they’re not tearing up the screen. In an unsettling introductory scene, a young Bi (Thuy Linh) loses her mother, a prostitute, after a drunken john attacks both women and accidentally sets fire to their tiny houseboat.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Hailee Steinfeld Kicks Butt As A Teenage Assassin In Barely Lethal Trailer</h2><time>Aug 4, 2024</time>

Fanboys&nbsp;director Kyle Newman is back with black action comedy Barely Lethal, which has now&nbsp;dropped its first trailer.

I've also had it with the force shield that protects the Enterprise. The power on this thing is always going down. In movie after movie after movie I have to sit through sequences during which the captain is tersely informed that the front shield is down to 60 percent, or the back shield is down to 10 percent, or the side shield is leaking energy, and the captain tersely orders that power be shifted from the back to the sides or all put in the front, or whatever, and I'm thinking, life is too short to sit through 10 movies in which the power is shifted around on these shields.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Details Found In Pop Smoke's Death Certificate</h2><time>Aug 3, 2024</time>
<a href=../../details-found-in-pop-smokes-death-certificate.html></a>
Pop Smoke's death certificate is now online and reveals a wealth of information about him. Some of it is personal. We read that Pop Smoke's birth name was Bashar Barakah Jackson, that he was born in New York in 1999, and that he was of Panamanian descent through his father and Jamaican through his mother (although Pop Smoke himself had lived his whole life in the United States). He had started but not finished college, and had never married.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Head movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1968)</h2><time>Aug 3, 2024</time>
<a href=../../head-1968.html></a>
The Monkees themselves are a harmless lot, little pop-idol puppies who can't sing, can't dance, can't talk, don't need to. The movie fits them into a plot somehow reminiscent of "A Hard Day's Night" and then forgets them. They themselves admit, at the film's beginning, that they're a "manufactured image," and the film tries to dismantle and discredit the image. Sometimes it succeeds.
But the Monkees, dismantled or not, aren't really at the heart of the film, and their songs are so forgettable that you have trouble remembering how they began, before they end.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How do you evolve Monferno arceus?</h2><time>Aug 3, 2024</time>
