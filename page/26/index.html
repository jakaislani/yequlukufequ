Any film that takes a somewhat realistic view of space travel is bound to get compared to "2001: A Space Odyssey," but this one deserves it. It makes the ship feel as tactile as the interior of a submarine, or a prison. Atmosphere and sensation are everything.&nbsp;The sound of a character's breathing, footsteps or muttered curses&nbsp;can be as meaningful&nbsp;as any expository line of dialogue (of which there are surprisingly few until Binoche's spacey-scary Dr.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is Joe Cruz leaving Chicago Fire?</h2><time>Jul 24, 2024</time>

It has been over a decade since the fictional version of the Chicago Fire Department‚Äôs Firehouse 51 found its place on NBC. Sadly, the ongoing onslaught of chaos in the fictional lives of Chicago Fire‚Äôs firefighters, paramedics, and rescue staff has done little to quell the changes behind the camera, particularly when it comes to original characters leaving the show.
Recommended Videos For long-time loyal fans of the network drama, it is still difficult to remember that we no longer have Lieutenant Matthew Casey, Paramedic Leslie Shay, firefighter Peter Mills, and so many more who either left Chicago Fire, or else their character met tragic deaths in the line of their fictional duties.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Robert Emmet Lunney movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>Jul 24, 2024</time>

‚ÄúPeople would say, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs too healthy. That‚Äôs too green,‚Äô‚Äù the Clark Atlanta University alum explained in a phone interview.

A few years ago, Jack and I visited Copenhagen, where we ate lots and lots (and lots) of Sm√∏rrebr√∏d. If you aren‚Äôt familiar with sm√∏rrebr√∏d, they are open faced sandwiches with artfully-piled toppings on dense, rectangle-shaped rye bread.

GPU Performance: 2-4x For Productivity, Mixed Gaming Arguably the star of the show for Apple‚Äôs latest Mac SoCs is the GPU, as well as the significant resources that go into feeding it. While Apple doesn‚Äôt break down how much of their massive, 57 billion transistor budget on the M1 Max went to the GPU, it and its associated hardware were the only thing to be quadrupled versus the original M1 SoC.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Samsung SSD 840 Pro (256GB) Review</h2><time>Jul 23, 2024</time>

If we had an award for most improved in the SSD space, it would have to go to Samsung. When we first encountered Samsung MLC drives a few years ago they were pretty bad. Prices were high and performance was low. Samsung offered no end-user upgradable firmware for those early drives either, although that was eventually rectified. The first Samsung MLC SSDs were reliable, they just weren't worth the money when you had much better options from companies like Intel.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Why is Missy Elliot Famous?
