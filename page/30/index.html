Zoe is surprised that her old friend is not hoping for what his culture calls a “love marriage.” She certainly has no interest in the handsome, kind, funny young veterinarian her mother (Emma Thompson, having a blast) wants her to marry. Yet, Zoe has her own conflicts around love, with a history of relationships so short-lived none of them qualifies as likely to stick around long enough to watch an entire TV series together.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>25 Richest Golfers in the World</h2><time>Jul 15, 2024</time>

So, for those who wish to take a trip down memory lane and revisit some of their favorite rom-coms, here’s the list for you.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Can you say God bless you to a Jehovah Witness?</h2><time>Jul 15, 2024</time>
<a href=../../can-you-say-god-bless-you-to-a-jehovah-witness.html></a>
Jehovah's Witnesses don't say “god bless you” when someone sneezes, because that practice supposedly has a pagan origin. What things are Jehovah Witnesses not allowed to do? The denomination requires adherence to a strict moral code, which forbids premarital sex, homosexuality, gender transitioning, adultery, smoking, drunkenness and drug abuse, and blood transfusions. Why shouldn't you say Bless you? Please stop acknowledging my bodily functions. "Bless you" is a phrase so reflexively spoken upon hearing a sneeze that many of us forgot or don't even know where it came from.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How tall is Calista Flockhart</h2><time>Jul 15, 2024</time>

<a href=../../paint-movie-review-2023.html></a>
There’s a big hole in McAdams’ directorial debut where our compassion for Carl should be. Carl is stuck at the beginning of "Paint" and finds himself repeatedly painting the same landmark of Mt. Mansfield (one of many ongoing jokes that would be funnier with better pacing). Such creative stasis makes way for a weak subplot about a replacement—a younger painter named Ambrosia (Ciara Renée) who follows his time slot and can fill two complete canvases in one hour, as opposed to Carl’s one.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/29/>← Prev Page</a>
