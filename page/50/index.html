The Imperial Inquisitors are one of the smartest additions to Star Wars. In Obi-Wan Kenobi, Rebels, and Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order (and also in many comics and novels) we’ve seen the Jedi that survived Order 66 struggling to keep their true identity hidden as the Empire hunts them down. Darth Vader is their biggest fear, but even he can’t be everywhere at once and he relies on the Inquisitors to tie up loose ends.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Original Captain Marvel Post-Credits Scene Connected To Thor: Ragnarok</h2><time>Jun 4, 2024</time>

Though much of Captain Marvel takes place on Earth, Carol Danvers’ solo debut still has one foot firmly placed in the cosmic end of the MCU. In fact, if directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck had followed through on one of their early ideas, then the movie may have ended on the same planet that a certain God of Thunder would unintentionally visit a couple of decades later. And since this unrealized idea ties in heavily with the conclusion of Captain Marvel, be warned that some pretty big spoilers lie ahead.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What Is Relish?

Barney Douglas’ new Showtime documentary, simply titled “McEnroe,” finds its titular 63-year-old subject in a pleasingly reflective mode, suggesting that he has grown more palatable with age. Lukas Tucknott’s strikingly artful cinematography deliberately imitates the noir aesthetic of Michael Mann’s masterful 1981 debut feature, “Thief,” in which its protagonist was doomed to a life he strove to fight against, one of perpetual alienation. Tennis is by its very nature a lonesome sport, requiring its players to rely solely on their own skillset while blotting out the pressure that aims to distract them at every turn.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>MrBeast: How do scammers benefit from giveaway 1000 dollars pop-up scam?</h2><time>Jun 3, 2024</time>
