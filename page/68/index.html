Whereas making a funny political satire in the United States about a Russian submarine running aground on a sandbank near a small island town off the coast of New England in 1966 during the height of the Cold War - and having local townsfolk help them escape in the end via a convoy of small boats, thereby protecting them from US Navy planes until they're safely out to sea?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Kaizer Chiefs Fixtures 2022/2023 Standings, Table &amp;amp; Results</h2><time>Apr 29, 2024</time>
