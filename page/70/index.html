<a href=../../easter-sundae-mms-review.html></a>
When I first heard that the new M&M’s hitting stores for the annual Easter candy-buying season were called Easter Sundae M&M’s, I asked myself (and the rest of the Sporked crew, unfortunately), “Is an ‘Easter sundae’ a thing I’m not aware of?” I promise I’m a college-educated adult with an (almost) fully functioning brain, but the very obvious pun sailed right over my big, dumb head. Easter Sunday: a thing. Easter Sundae: not a thing…until now!</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Yvan Buravan- Wiki, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Ethnicity, Career</h2><time>Apr 27, 2024</time>

Nobody knows where she came from
The tall-and-tanned-young-and-lovely girl
With a voice as light as air
Nobody knows but no one cares
'Cause everybody loves her
When she signs makes you dream a fairy taleWith a certain smile
She can make you feel so nice
Saying gently "Goodbye sadness"
Still will break your heart
Listen to her once
You'll feel lucky she was there
One note samba would never be the same</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Amy Georgiou Obituary Sacramento California, Amy Georgiou Has Passed Away Death</h2><time>Apr 26, 2024</time>
