For background, DeSantis has made it a personal mission to stop what he calls “woke” ideology, and he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pushes discriminatory laws</a> against people of color and homosexuals while hiding it under the guise of “protecting children.” Take a look at the clip:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Billy Goats on The View compare Christians to the Taliban.

I’ve said this before, and it’s been in print. I don’t know what the difference between our Christian Right and the Taliban is. I have no idea what the difference is.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=111 data-injectable=false>She then said religion was “dangerous” and she didn’t like what was happening in the country.</p><p>“It’s not this country. It’s not America. When I was growing up, I didn’t know America was an experiment. They never said America was an experiment when we were growing up. It was a democracy. And now it’s in such danger. It’s so upsetting. It’s upsetting to hear the loudest voices and not any kind of pushback to the loudest voices that are the extremity in this country.”</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>The Taliban, for the record, are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not great to women</a>. Women are not allowed to go to college, and girls can’t go to secondary school. They can’t enter public baths, amusement parks, gyms or sports clubs. They cannot work and they cannot drive. The Taliban also carries out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">public executions</a>.</p><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true>The Christian Right mostly doesn’t want women to have abortions. I’m not saying they’re great, but they’re not killing people in the streets. They don’t want to stop women from having rights, just the right to choose what goes on in their own bodies. Is that terrible? Yes, but it’s still not the Taliban.</p><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>Just to be clear here: The Taliban is also not taking away rights from anyone in the U.S., and they are not actively trying to do so. Lupone’s views are islamophobic and just perpetuate a dangerous rhetoric against non-Americans. In essence, she’s doing exactly what she’s accusing the right of doing: being discriminatory. Wait! Both sides are bad? What are the chances?</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=644 data-injectable=true>Lupone also went hard at former President Donald Trump, saying the charges against him are “not enough.” As for Representative Jim Jordan, who recently travelled to New York for a publicity stunt… oops! I mean to have a hearing on crime.</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>Just want to point out that Rep. Jordan represents Tennessee, not New York, and his trip was a pretty obvious failed attempt at trying to control the narrative. Maybe he should’ve said the Taliban were like the Christian right.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S9osDTomSlraCku6Z506ugoJ%2BVp8BurcutZKuhl53Bbr%2FNqK6fpJGgsrR5w66poqaXYsGpsYyvoJ6vXZa9sbHAq5inm5Vir7p5wqikqZminruoecKhqaKrpJ6ur3nRop6hrF2pvG7Ax55krZmcnq%2Biuo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nvidia-launches-tesla-k20-k20x-gk110-arrives-at-last.html><span>←</span><span>NVIDIA Launches Tesla K20 &amp;amp; K20X: GK110 Arrives At Last</span></a>
