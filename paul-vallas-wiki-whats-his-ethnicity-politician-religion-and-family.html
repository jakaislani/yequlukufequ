Daley’s chief of staff.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Paul-Vallas-1.jpg alt="Paul Vallas" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Vallas was named CEO of the Chicago Public Schools in 1995, where he oversaw major increases in student performance, test scores, and graduation rates.
