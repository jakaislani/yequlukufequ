You heard of “Star Wars”? Films based on Sparks' books could be called “Star-Crossed Wars.”
The two-hour-plus “Ride,” No. 10 in the series, at least offers a few intriguing new variations on the usual Sparks formula of pretty bland people falling in love against a backdrop of verdantly green landscapes most often located in coastal North Carolina. For instance, this might be one of the few movie plots in history to prominently feature both bull riding and art appreciation.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is Kanye Wests Vultures 1 on Spotify?</h2><time>Aug 17, 2024</time>

It is an undeniable fact that Kanye West’s long-awaited new album, Vultures, is not on Spotify – unless it is – instead releasing on Apple Music – except when it’s not.
Recommended Videos As with any story about Ye, this is exhausting.

Whiskey may not be everyone’s first choice when they’re reaching for a liquor with which to mix a quick drink. I get it. Whiskey has a big, bold flavor and that can make it tougher to pair with whichever soda, sparkling water, orjuice you might have on hand. But if you stock up on the right carbonated beverages, whiskey can really sing. (Oh, and please note we’re talking about American and Canadian whiskeys here—if you insist on mixing scotch with anything besides plain club soda, you’re on your own.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Walter Williamson movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>Aug 17, 2024</time>

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA: Haleigh Rosa, the SKIMS model who was the target of Candace Owens' allegedly ableist comments, expressed her disgust towards the controversial talk show host's remarks. Owens had criticized the new SKIMS campaign, which showcased paraplegic model Rosa sitting in her wheelchair while wearing the adaptive bralette and panties specifically created for people with disabilities.

The film was written and directed by John Hughes, who previously has specialized in high-quality teenage movies, such as "Sixteen Candles" and "The Breakfast Club." One hallmark of Hughes' work is his insistence that his characters have recognizable human qualities; he doesn't work with a cookie cutter, and the teenage roles he wrote for Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Matthew Broderick and others helped transform Holywood's idea of what a teenage movie could be.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/13/>← Prev Page</a>
