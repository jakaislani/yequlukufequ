With the much-anticipated&nbsp;Borderlands 3 landing in just over two weeks, whoever at Gearbox made the decision to have a promotional crossover with&nbsp;Fortnite deserves a pat on the back. The games are just different enough to not compete directly with one another while sharing similar gameplay loops. Plus, with much of&nbsp;Fortnite‚Äòs playerbase skewing younger,&nbsp;Fortnite x Mayhem is a great way to inform&nbsp;them about Borderlands, especially considering that the last full game in the series was released way back in 2012.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ghost Energy Flavors, Ranked [Taste Test]</h2><time>Jun 8, 2024</time>

Now, I can‚Äôt say that I personally would want to consume 16 ounces of carbonated liquid that tastes like cotton candy bubble gum, but this taste test isn‚Äôt about me.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Kid Cuisine Review: How Good Is It as an Adult?</h2><time>Jun 8, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../kid-cuisine-review-how-good-as-adult.html></a>
As a child, Kid Cuisine was one of my favorite ‚Äúspecial treat‚Äù meals. Just seeing that cool, skateboarding penguin makes my mouth water for corn niblets and chicken nuggies. But does it hold up?
I grew up in a home that prioritized good food above all else. We booked vacations around meals. We had nightly dinner at the dining room table. There was no ‚Äúkid‚Äôs option,‚Äù which was fine because my parents are both excellent cooks and I was happy to scarf down jambalaya or frittata or shredded Brussels sprouts with bacon or whatever else they whipped up.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Michael Reeves: Girlfriend, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body facts</h2><time>Jun 8, 2024</time>
