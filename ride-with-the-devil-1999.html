<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Ride with the Devil movie review (1999)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The movie is slow and deliberate--too slow. It begins with the enigma of heroes whose cause we do not share, and then has them spend much of their time hunched inside a hideout they have built into a hillside (where it never occurs to them that if they'd fill the chinks between the logs it might be warmer inside). They have long conversations, delivered in language that seems more suited to sermons and editorials than to everyday speech.</p><p>Their hideout is on the land of a Missouri family who supports the Confederacy, and soon Chiles is falling in love with Sue Lee (Jewel), a war widow. To give the film credit, it doesn't degenerate into a conventional romance, but plays both Chiles and Sue Lee as desperate in their own ways for an escape from an intolerable situation. There are also grim passages involving wounds, amputations and desperate armed raids.</p><p>The technical and acting credits are first rate. <a href=#>Frederick Elmes</a>, who also shot "The Ice Storm," has an uncanny ability to evoke cold and damp. The actors do a good job of being contained by their characters--by not letting modern insights peek through. Jeffrey Wright, who starred in "<a href=#>Basquiat</a>," is especially intriguing as the freed slave, who keeps his own counsel throughout the movie without sending out signals about what he's doing. Jewel deserves praise for, quite simply, performing her character in a convincing and unmannered way. She is an actress here, not a pop star trying out a new hobby. Ulrich is good, too, although Tobey Maguire's tone--tight, inward, controlled--is beginning to wear on me after this and "<a href=#>The Cider House Rules</a>." It's time for him to make a dumb teenage comedy (not because I want to see it, but more to clear the cobwebs).</p><p>Watching the film, I could see that Ang Lee and his frequent collaborator, screenwriter <a href=#>James Schamus</a>, were in search of something serious. "Ride With the Devil" does not have conventional rewards or payoffs, does not simplify a complex situation, doesn't punch up the action or the romance simply to entertain. But it is, sad to say, not a very entertaining movie; it's a long slog unless you're fascinated by the undercurrents. It's a film that would inspire useful discussion in a history class, but for ordinary moviegoers, it's slow and forbidding.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46roJ2dXay2tbSMrZ%2BeZZSaw6q4jGpwcnE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alia-zuidema-obituary-michigan-resident-and-grand-haven-member.html><span>←</span><span>Alia Zuidema Obituary, Michigan Resident and Grand Haven Member</span></a>
