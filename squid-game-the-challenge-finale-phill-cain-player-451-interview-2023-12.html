"That's living rent-free in my brain every single day."</p><p class=premium>Here, Cain speaks to Business Insider about losing one of reality television's biggest cash prizes at the last hurdle, as well as their incredible performance in the "Circle of Trust" game, and what they plan to do next.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Phill Cain looking down at the feast in the season one finale of "Squid Game: The Challenge." <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Netflix</span></span></figure><p class=premium><strong>You're one of the few competitors who knew who'd won. How difficult was it to keep that a secret for half a year?</strong></p><p class=premium>That was very difficult because I wanted people to be excited about the show, but I legally wasn't allowed to talk about it. And I was going through so much having come so close and not having quite gotten it. I wasn't able to talk to almost anybody about it. That was tough.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=premium><strong>In the "Circle of Trust" game, you correctly guessed who put the box on your desk both times. How did you manage to play the game so well? Did you have a strategy?</strong></p><p class=premium>I want to clarify that I was freaking out the whole time.</p><p class=premium>When Rose put the box on my desk, I was kind of confident that it was her because we didn't know each other super well.</p><p class=premium>With Ashley, it was a shot in the dark. I was like, "Okay, Ashley's the smartest person in the room right now. I know that she's willing to be cunning and cutthroat to get what she wants." I knew Sam would never put it on my desk, so I was kind of between Hallie, Mai, and Ashley. So I went with Ashley.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=premium>The reason I was so dramatic about it was because I thought I was about to get eliminated. I was like, "You know what? I might as well have some fun with it. I might as well get my camera time and just be silly, and whatever happens, happens." I was just as shocked as the audience to find out that I was right.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Phill Cain does a dramatic gesture in "Squid Game: The Challenge" episode nine. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Netflix</span></span></figure><p class=premium><strong>You played it off well. When you dramatically pointed at Ashley, some fans thought that was a reference to the </strong><a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow><strong><u>"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney"</u></strong></a><strong> video game…</strong></p><p class=premium>No, I didn't realize that that was a thing until after the show aired and people started coming up to me like, "Oh, are you a big anime fan?" I don't know what anime is. I've never seen anime. So that was just me being silly.</p><p class=premium><strong>During the feast in episode 10, what made you decide not to step up during the button test?</strong></p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=premium>That was a moment in the game where I was genuinely scared. I didn't know what to do. The fact that both Mai and Sam stepped up was really courageous of them.</p><p class=premium>Also, I had a confident feeling that if either of them were able to choose somebody to go with them to the finals, they would both probably choose me. It was almost safer for me not to do anything.</p><p class=premium><strong>How did you feel when you discovered the final game was rock, paper, scissors?</strong></p><p class=premium>I said, "This is the silliest thing I've ever seen in my life." But honestly, no better way to do it, right? It's mostly chance, or at least I thought it was mostly chance.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=premium>It was a relief to be so close to the end, winning or not. At the end of the day, I could at least go home to my bed, I could eat some good food, I could see my friends, I could see my partner that I was missing so much.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Mai Whelan and Phill Cain in the final challenge on episode 10 of "Squid Game: The Challenge" season one. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Netflix</span></span></figure><p class=premium><strong>Why do you think Mai did so much better than you in that final challenge?</strong></p><p class=premium>I was thinking that she just got wicked lucky, and I was like, "Oh, my God, my luck just ran out." After watching the finale, I was like, "Oh, my God, she had a strategy to it." I had no idea. I was fully winging it the whole time.</p><p class=premium>We played like 33 or something rounds of rock, paper, scissors, and we went through most of the keys. There were like 40 keys. And she whooped my butt for most of that time. The edit was very kind to me and made it look like I won a few, but she won most of them easy.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=premium>But it is what it is. I'm very grateful to have been a part of it, and I'm very glad that the money is going to somebody that I can trust to do good with it.</p><p class=premium><strong>Is there anything that you wish you could change or do differently?</strong></p><p class=premium>Probably picked that key. But other than that, I think I played as best as I could have.</p><p class=premium>I came out a stronger and more resilient person. I came out with relationships and friendships that are going to last a lifetime.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=premium>I am passionate about music and coming out of the show not having won, I learned I don't really need that money to pursue my passions. That's actually what I've been up to for the past few months.</p><p class=premium><strong>The show has been renewed for a </strong><a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel><strong>second season</strong></a><strong>. If there was ever an all-stars season of "Squid Game: The Challenge," would you return?</strong></p><p class=premium>At this point, I got to run it back, see what happens. Give me one more shot. Give me one more chance.</p><p class=premium>This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufony0vdSim2afkaKybsDHnmScoJGhuaa6xp5kn6Gelrmmec%2BhoKWkXZiuqrqMqaOasZWnenWBkGagp6yVp8OqsdZmaWlqY2J%2Bcw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matt-zoller-seitz.html><span>←</span><span>Matt Zoller Seitz biography &amp;amp; movie reviews</span></a>
