So it was especially sad for Ozzy when Lenny became unwell. According to an interview Ozzy gave to Metal Hammer a few years after Lemmy died (<a href=#>via The Express</a>), the Prince of Darkness was probably the last person to speak to Lemmy on the phone, on December 28, 2015, since he died very shortly thereafter, of prostate cancer, cardiac arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure. It was a painful final call, for Ozzy as well.</p><p dir=ltr>"I knew he was dying. He didn't even know it was me," Ozzy explained. "I had to say to him, 'It's Ozzy, Lem.' He just gurgled down the phone to me. I said, 'Lemmy, for f***'s sake, stay there. I'm coming.'"</p><p dir=ltr>But this would be the last time the two talked, and the last time Lemmy talked to anyone on the phone. Unfortunately, Ozzy wouldn't make it to him in time, even though he went as fast as possible. He says that as soon as he hung up the phone, "I said to Sharon, 'F*** it, get in the car. We're going round to his apartment.' And just as we were leaving she came up to me and said, 'Don't worry, he's gone.'" At least Ozzy got to say goodbye to his friend at a very rock 'n' roll memorial, which he called "something else."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAlWxobW5fqbWmecuaqq1loJ28r7GMnJilpF2ptaa%2FxGapqJubYsC1rdGsZKaZlJp6o7HFqKmeZaSdsrp5w6KcnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ted-sutherland.html><span>←</span><span>Ted Sutherland Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</span></a>
