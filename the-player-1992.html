<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>The Player movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1992)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>"The Player" follows Griffin (<a href=#>Tim Robbins</a>) during a period when his big paycheck, his luxury car and his expensive lifestyle seem to be in danger. There is another shark in the pond, a younger executive (<a href=#>Peter Gallagher</a>) who may be even sleeker and greedier, and who may get Griffin's job. This challenge comes at a bad time: Griffin is shedding a girl friend (a woman whose superior intelligence he feeds on, while treating the rest of her like a shabby possession). And there are those postcards. Who is sending the postcards? Griffin racks his memory and his secretary's appointment book. He has lied to so many writers that there is no way to narrow the field. Finally he picks one name and calls the guy for a meeting. The guy's girl friend says he's out in Pasadena, seeing "<a href=#>The Bicycle Thief</a>" at a revival house. Griffin drives out there, meets the guy, has a conversation with him, follows him back to a parking lot, and kills him. As if Griffin didn't have enough problems already.</p><p>The movie then follows Griffin's attempts to protect his position at the studio, evade arrest for murder, and conduct a romance with the dead man's fiancé (<a href=#>Greta Scacchi</a>), who if anything is more cynical than Griffin. This story was first told in a novel by <a href=#>Michael Tolkin</a>, who made it so compelling I read it in a single sitting. Now Altman has made it funny as well, without losing any of the lacerating anger and satire.</p><p>Altman fills his film with dozens of cameos by recognizable stars, most of them saying exactly what's on their minds. And he surrounds Griffin with the kind of oddball characters who seem to roll into Los Angeles, as if the continent was on a tilt: <a href=#>Whoopi Goldberg</a> as a Pasadena police detective who finds Griffin hilarious, <a href=#>Fred Ward</a> as a studio security chief who has seen too many old "<a href=#>Dragnet</a>" episodes, <a href=#>Sydney Pollack</a> as a lawyer who does for the law what Griffin does for the cinema, <a href=#>Lyle Lovett</a> as a sinister figure lurking on the fringes of many gatherings.</p><p>Watching "The Player," we want to despise Griffin Mill, but we can't quite manage that. He is not dumb. He has a certain verbal charm. As played by Tim Robbins, he is tall, with a massive forehead but a <a href=#>Dana Carvey</a> smile, and he wears a suit well. Watching him in some shots, especially when the camera is below eye level and Altman uses a mock-heroic composition, we realize with a shock that Griffin looks uncannily like the young "<a href=#>Citizen Kane</a>". He has a similar morality, too, but not the breadth of vision.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55loKGuurHRZmhycWI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-best-true-crime-podcasts-of-2023.html><span>←</span><span>The 8 best true crime podcasts of 2023</span></a>
