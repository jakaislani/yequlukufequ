It’s a horror film. A lot of the times people are going there for the death scenes and for those elements and we’ve really upped the ante. I think the last time I did a count there was over 30 deaths in the movie, which is quite substantial compared to most movies. I think that’s at least over three times what the first film had and there’s various massacres and stuff. So there’s a lot of blood and a lot of gore. It’s magnitudes higher compared to what it was on the first film. It’s over 10 times what it was.”</p><p data-characters=159 data-current-count=159 data-injectable=false>10 times more expensive is one thing, but will it be 10 times better?
