She wrote: ‚ÄúWhy y‚Äôall do Annalise like this? ü§£‚ù§ #AnnaliseKeating #HTGAWM‚Äù Davis included a meme of her as Annalise Keating looking tired and fed up with the words: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so tired of leftovers, this morning I had a mac n cheese and yams omelet.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=512 data-current-count=827 data-injectable=true>Annalise Keating is one of the main characters in the hit ABC thriller <a href=#>How To Get Away With Murder</a> played by Davis for six seasons. This show was created by Peter Nowalk and produced by Shonda Rhimes. Keating is a defense attorney and law professor who gets a little too close to a murder plot along with some of her students. Viola won an Emmy and 2 of her SAG awards for this series. This made her the first African-American woman to win the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series.</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>So while Thanksgiving leftovers being forced upon eaters for a fourth or even fifth time is a burden many Americans have had to bear this week, Davis would like you to remember her extensive acting resume. Perhaps use <strong><a href=#>Meryl Streep</a></strong> for all your meme needs instead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9WipqWZXZmut7XSZqmemZyhxm7DyKyfnqtdrry2edaorKWcXajBsLyMrayrppmjtG60xKtkoqakpHqiedGemJysmaS7brnEppxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./princess-michael-of-kents-racist-brooch-worn-while-meeting-meghan-markle-stuns-royal-fans.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Princess Michael of Kent's 'racist' brooch worn while meeting Meghan Markle stuns Royal fans</span></a>
