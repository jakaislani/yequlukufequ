People ring in the holiday (which, fun fact, is a legal holiday only in Louisiana) on the Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday as a way to close out the pre-Lenten season. Given that it is a pre-Lent celebration and Lent is when people kick things like junk food and booze until Easter arrives, you should definitely plan on bringing some indulgent foods while you can still enjoy them. These are some of the richest foods and fanciest drinks to bring to a Mardi Gras party, beside the king cake.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

That they’re sort of a rarity makes these sweet passion fruit-and-rum drinks even more fun. Sporked managing editor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwynedd Stuart</a> tried the two big brands of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hurricane mix</a> on the market (the other one is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Franco’s</a>, if you prefer a powdered mix), and Pat O’Brien’s came out on top. “It’s saccharine, it’s red, it tastes like something you’ll regret drinking tomorrow, but in a fun way,” Gwynedd wrote. “I couldn’t necessarily pinpoint the flavor of passion fruit in either mix, but I’m not an expert either. If you’re celebrating Mardi Gras, order a couple of bottles of the best Hurricane mix out there: Pat O’Brien’s.” Just make sure you Uber to the party.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Abita Strawberry Lager</strong></a><p>Nothing says Mardi Gras like an ice-cold Abita beer. Now, you’re probably thinking about Purple Haze right off the bat, but we have a different thought for you: Abita Strawberry Lager. Sporked editor-in-chief <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justine Sterling</a> tried <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">every Abita beer</a> she could get her hands on here in L.A. and this berry-tinged beer was her surprise favorite. “I love this beer,” Justine wrote. “It has a bright and fruity nose. And the flavor is the perfect balance of lager and tangy, not-too-sweet strawberry flavor. I could drink this all day—starting with brunch.” Don’t worry, party people will be into it at night, too.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Zapp’s Voodoo Chips</strong></a><p>Zapp’s potato chips may be made by a Pennsylvania company now, but they’ve been a Louisiana classic since the ’80s—and their unique, spicy flavors make them a Mardi Gras-party must. The brand’s Voodoo flavor was reportedly created by accident, and it’s definitely a happy one. They’re sweet, tangy, and just a little bit smoky—they reminded Gwynedd of a vinegary, almost Carolina-style BBQ sauce. “Every single chip is like eating an entire meal,” she wrote. This is also the chip of choice of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mythical Kitchen‘s Nicole Enayati</a>. See, you’re in good company.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kirkland Signature Premium Margarita Cocktail Mix</strong></a><p>What if you get to the party and they’ve run out of mixers? Well, bring this big ol’ bottle of margarita mix and the party is back in biz. Justine tasted a bunch of margarita mixes, and Kirkland Margarita Cocktail Mix was the <a href=#>best margarita mix</a> she tried. It’s on the sweeter side, but that that’s okay because that sweetness serves to “balance out the alcohol of the tequila.” It’s perfect for tequila lovers and tequila haters alike.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Smirnoff Spicy Tamarind</strong></a><p>I tried this at a party once and I’ve been thinking about it ever since. This vodka has a nice, spicy kick that pairs well with Tajín because of its sweet and tangy tamarind flavor. Pop some of this in a popsicle mold mixed with chamoy and Tajín, and I guarantee these festive boozy pops will be the talk of the party (and the next party after that and…).</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Trader Joe’s Unexpected Cheddar Spread</strong></a><p>It’s pure CHEESE!! What could be more indulgent than that? In Justine’s <a href=#>review of this spread</a>, she gave it high marks (9.5 out of 10 Sporks). It is an excellent sharp cheddar-esque spread that’s tangy and creamy all at once. She also informed us that this spread would go great on a variety of things like sliced apples, a sandwich, crackers, or a “fistful of sprouts.” Okay, maybe no one wants to eat a fistful of sprouts at a Mardi Gras party, so you could spring <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">for some of these puppies</a>, too.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Fudge Brownie M&M’s</strong></a><p>I whole-heartedly believe that Fudge Brownie M&M’s are the most indulgent M&M’s. Each one is like a mini candy-coated cake pop. “They actually managed to channel the flavor of a baked good into a tiny morsel that adds chew and a deeper chocolatey flavor to the entire candy,” Gwynedd wrote in her ranking of the <a href=#>best M&M’s flavors</a>. If you bring a giant share-sized bag of these to a Mardi Gras party, people planning on kicking chocolate for lent will thank you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFuwM5mmauhnpx6tbuMmmSmmaKZtm6z0ZqqZqiRp8G6ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./peyton-robinson.html><span>←</span><span>Peyton Robinson biography &amp;amp; movie reviews</span></a>
