With numerous videos exchanged between these two TikTokers, determining who is right or wrong becomes quite challenging. Moreover, for the average TikTok user who scrolls away their time, understanding the actual events becomes even more perplexing. If you’re curious, here’s a simple breakdown of everything that went on.</p><h2 id=h-what-s-the-drama-between-taybeepboop-and-kaarin-joy data-injectable=false>What’s the drama between TayBeepBoop and Kaarin Joy?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@littlescarystories href=#>@littlescarystories</a><p>Taybeepboop and Kaarin Joy Drama from beginning to end Tays videos have been shortened.

Within these ‘coincidences,’ TayBeepBoop points out that Joy painted her kitchen with blue and green, crafted wall art reminiscent of both TayBeepBoop’s and her husband’s creations, and even made a mirror similar to one TayBeepBoop had previously created.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>Given that TayBeepBoop’s entire schtick revolves around DIY-ing and crafting everything around the house, it’s not surprising to most that Joy drew inspiration from the content creator. After all, the essence of DIY is to craft those items ourselves. Regrettably, TayBeepBoop didn’t share this perspective and created a video explaining how Kaarin Joy’s content was centered around crafting similar material.</p><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>In due course, Kaarin Joy presented her side of the narrative, revealing that she had been a devoted admirer of TayBeepBoop’s content for an extended period of time. This admiration frequently propelled her to create crafts akin to those crafted by the DIY creator. Furthermore, Joy clarified that TayBeepBoop had messaged her before, requesting that she cease producing content influenced by her work. This all led to TayBeepBoop crafting the video mentioned earlier, wherein she highlighted the alleged “coincidences.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.tiktok.com/@kaarinjoy/video/7262426628876274990</figure><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=706 data-injectable=true>Of course, it didn’t take long for TayBeepBoop to post an apology video, where she deemed her behavior as “wild and inappropriate,” admitting that she did not believe she had done “anything wrong,” for a long time. In the end, she apologized to Kaarin Joy, admitting to her mistakes after realizing it hadn’t been fair to ultimately gatekeep art that wasn’t hers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.tiktok.com/@taybeepboop/video/7263657347698969899</figure><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=706 data-injectable=true>While both parties apologized and shared their perspective on the issue, many netizens are still adamant about forgiving TayBeepBoop’s actions, with some comments under her video taking a less appreciative approach. “6/10.<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> needs ukulele</a>,” one user humorously added, while many others simply kept asking if they needed permission every time they wanted to create anything similar to hers.</p><p>Can I get that excact catus on the top left of your mirror or do I need to ask permission?</p>maddie ᰔᩚᰔᩚ<p>Honestly this whole drama was so juicy.
