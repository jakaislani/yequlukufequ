Meanwhile, Bunnie had money, but was unsatisfied with her line of work. "I might've seen her with money, but I seen her at her lowest too," the "Son of a Sinner" artist recalled on the podcast <a href=#>"Andrew Schulz's Flagrant with Akaash Singh"</a> in August 2023.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>The pair wasted no time, and discussed how they could change their lives. "She jokes that first night that I asked for a five-year plan. That next morning we really did make a five-year plan," Roll said. According to Roll, Bunnie had mentioned starting a podcast that first night together — she now has the popular "Dumb Blonde Podcast."</p><p dir=ltr>Roll and Bunnie dove head first into building their lives together, and took the same approach when they decided to get hitched. "We got married kind of randomly," he recalled on "The Golden Hour" podcast in 2020. The "Dead Man Walking" singer said it was a spur of the moment decision to get married one night in Las Vegas. To celebrate their six-year wedding anniversary in 2022, Roll made an <a href=#>Instagram</a> post where he recalled how the couple "stumbled into [a] court house drunk and got married." For their seven-year anniversary, Roll and Bunnie renewed their vows in that same wedding chapel. One major change was Bunnie was able to rock a beautiful dress that time around.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Once together, Bunnie had an indelible impact on Roll's family life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxmaH14fo6wn6KqnKy2r7CMrKuaqqRit6a4y7Jkq6ecoXq4tcWeZJutnqO2pnnXqGSrp52Wu6Sxjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shaquille-oneal-parents-meet-lucille-oneal-and-joe-toney.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Lucille O'Neal and Joe Toney</span></a>
