Everything to Know Here</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Hulk Hogan is engaged at 69: The retired wrestler has been married twice before! &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Hulk Hogan</strong> is the undisputed biggest superstar of wrestling. Hogan contributed over three decades of his life to the sport that was once deemed barbarian. Hogan is often attributed with taking the sport into the mainstream. He retired from his stellar wrestling career in 2012 and branched his career into acting. &nbsp;</p><p>Born Terry Gene Bollea on August 11, 1953, in Augusta, Georgia, he was a musician before venturing into the wrestling world after impressing some trained wrestlers with his physical features. Bollea's wrestling career took off in the 80s after he signed for WWE. Named after the giant superhero, Hogan-induced Hulkmania was all the rave through the 80s and 90s. &nbsp;</p><h3>Inside Hulk Hogan's Romantic History! &nbsp;</h3><p>Unfortunately, the greatest wrestler ever doesn't have a great personal history. Hogan has been married and divorced twice and both times, the WWE Hall of Famer was accused of infidelity. Bollea was a fast-growing figure in the wrestling industry when he married his first wife, <strong>Linda Hogan</strong>, a television personality, in 1983. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/26/345493894_236353952323780_8224160052818748009_n%20(1)%20(1)-1690387392782.jpg><p>Hogan's massive popularity and constant media presence at the time even landed the married couple their own show named<i> Hogan Knows Best</i>, which televised Hulk's very mundane, and often dramatic life with Linda, and their two kids, <a href=#>Nick,</a><strong> </strong>a television personality, and<strong> Brooke</strong>, an actor, singer, and entrepreneur.&nbsp;</p><p>The television series ran for four good seasons and came to an end after Hogan allegedly cheated on his wife with his daughter's friend, <strong>Christiane Plante</strong>, who confessed to the illicit affair. It was later revealed that Terry's marriage with Linda was already nearing its end when the wrestler did the unthinkable. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/26/338275690_1280181169520245_6482917857467822850_n%20(1)%20(1)-1690387401294.jpg><p>Hogan and Linda's divorce was finalized in 2009 and reports <a href=#>shared </a>that the betrayed wife received quite a hefty sum in the settlement, including a<i> $3 million</i> property settlement and 40% ownership in Hulk's various businesses. After his bitter split from Linda, the WWE star didn't waste any time in finding his next life partner. &nbsp;</p><p>Hogan started dating make-up artist <strong>Jennifer McDaniel</strong> in 2008. And after a year of dating bliss and divorce finalization with Linda, the WWE legend proposed to Jennifer in late 2009. The smitten pair enjoyed another year of bliss before tying the knot in December 2010. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/26/310730117_185300320658358_2699977262437951949_n%20(1)%20(1)-1690387408569.jpg><p>Fans were bound to speculate about Hogan's fidelity when the wrestler announced his separation from Jennifer and at the same time, debuted his new girlfriend. Hogan and McDaniel's marriage ended after 11 years in early 2022. Hogan cleared the air after he was snapped with a new beauty while still married to McDaniel. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/26/361741903_1003812354407099_8648920852724348831_n%20(1)%20(1)-1690387414128.jpg><p>"Yo, Maniacs just for the record, the Facebook and Instagram posts are of me and my girlfriend Sky, I am officially divorced," Hogan tweeted while flaunting his new flame on his socials. The WWE alum added, "Sorry I thought everyone already knew, love my Maniacs4Life." Although the amount isn't disclosed, Hulk reportedly paid McDaniel a lump sum in their settlement. &nbsp;</p><h3>Hulk Hogan is Engaged to His New Girlfriend! &nbsp;</h3><p>Hogan is gearing up to walk down the aisle for the third time. And only time will tell if it'll be a charm or another big blunder for the wrestling legend. Hogan is engaged to the woman he started dating amid his split from Jennifer. Hogan's soon-to-be wife, <strong>Sky Daily</strong>, 45, is a yoga instructor. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hogan is engaged to his girlfriend of one year, Sky Daily!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>Hogan's engagement with Sky has brought a little more clarity into the duo's relationship. Hulk and Daily were reportedly matched by their mutual friends. The WWE fame announced the exciting news over the weekend at his friend's wedding. In the since-deleted Instagram clip, the retired wrestler can be heard saying, "She was crazy enough to say 'Yes brother,'" referring to his famous wrestling catchphrase. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/26/356376498_278953448043443_1300649522404964257_n%20(1)%20(1)-1690387422106.jpg><p>The former wrestler recently also <a href=#>gushed</a> about his budding romance with Sky. During his appearance on <strong>Theo Von'</strong>s <i>This Past Weekend</i> podcast, Hogan called Daily a good influence in his life. Hogan attributed his two failed marriages to his drinking problem and credited Daily for helping him quit. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jrCfqGWZqHqpwcukZKGnl5a7brnAq6minZRiwbB5xK%2Bcq7Gknbavs4ytpmajnqTEbrTEq5w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./peter-cook-wiki-biography-net-worth-age-career-relationship-famil-html.html><span>←</span><span>Peter Cook Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Age, Career, Relationship,Famil</span></a>
