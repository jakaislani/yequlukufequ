Tindall’s mother, Shena Sandefur, said she’d long been concerned about Scott’s treatment of her daughter, describing him as a “<a href=#>jealous boyfriend</a>” and alleging he tracked her daughter’s phone. Sandefur also said that Scott told her daughter he’d take her “someplace special” for her birthday around the same time she disappeared.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>According to <a href=#>FOX59</a>, Tindall was seen with Scott the same day she went missing, and witnesses reported Scott driving Tindall’s car.
